# HPC Mon

Thing we made to make us more aware of jobs running on the University of
Florida Hipergator cluster.

Built for use with the PBS batch system but adopting it to any queue that sends
emails is trivial.

## Instructions

1. Setup a Gmail account to receive emails from the PBS batch system.
2. Add Gmail username and password to `config.yml`.
3. Run `bin/hpcmon`.

## LICENSE

MIT v3. See `license.md` for details.
